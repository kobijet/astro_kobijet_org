### Description
You play as Jinjo the penguin, out one day enjoying some sledding with his unhatched egg. All of a sudden, an avalanche comes roaring down the mountain! Duck and weave through the trees and around the tumbling debris in this fast-paced rythm runner to help Jinjo keep his egg safe!

### Secret Santa Jam
Just like in a secret santa exchange, everyone is assigned a random giftee. Each participant then writes a letter to their santa with some information about themselves--about what games they like to play, what their favorite color is, or what they enjoy doing in their free time. Santas then have two weeks to create custom games or experiences inspired by their giftee's specifications and publish it at the end of the jam on Itch.io!
